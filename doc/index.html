<ul>
<li><a href="core.html"><code>&quot;prion/core.hpp&quot;</code></a> &#8211; Core utilities.</li>
<li><a href="unit-test.html"><code>&quot;prion/unit-test.hpp&quot;</code></a> &#8211; Unit testing utilities.</li>
</ul>

<p>Prion is a header-only library that basically represents the absolute minimum
set of common utilities that I&#8217;ve found a common need for in other projects,
without having to duplicate the code in all of them.</p>

<p>Everything in this library is in <code>namespace Prion</code>, and can be used either by
explicit namespace qualification or via <code>using namespace Prion</code>. In practise,
you should never use the <code>prion/core</code> module or its namespace explicitly; it
will be included automatically in any other library that needs it.</p>

<p>Since Prion is header-only, it is not necessary to build Prion before using it
with any other library. The makefile included here exists mainly to be
referenced by inclusion in other projects&#8217; makefiles; it can also be used to
run Prion&#8217;s own unit tests.</p>

<p>Prion is written in C++14; you will need an up-to-date C++ compiler, probably
a recent version of Clang or GCC. I developed it mainly on Mac OS X, currently
using Clang 7.0, as well as testing with GCC 4.9 and 5.x. All test builds are
made using strict compilation mode (<code>-Wall -Wextra -Werror</code>). It will not work
with any existing release of Microsoft Visual C++.</p>

<p>Because I&#8217;m primarily targeting a shortlist of compilers rather than a
specific edition of the C++ standard, the code makes a few assumptions that
are not guaranteed by the standard but are reliably true on all the system I
care about. These include:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>char</code> is always 8 bits.</li>
<li>128-bit integers are available as <code>__int128</code>.</li>
<li><code>float</code> and <code>double</code> are IEEE 32 and 64 bit types.</li>
<li>Symbols from the C library are always in the global namespace.</li>
</ul>

<p>On Microsoft Windows builds, including Prion will bring in the whole of
<code>&lt;windows.h&gt;</code>. This is annoying but unfortunately unavoidable for a library
that needs to make calls to system APIs while remaining header-only. (Under
Cygwin, this will only happen if <code>_WIN32</code> is defined.)</p>
