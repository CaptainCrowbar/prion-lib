<h1 id="prionlibrary">Prion Library</h1>

<h4 id="minimalcommonutilitiesbyrosssmith">Minimal common utilities by Ross Smith</h4>

<p>This is a header-only library that basically represents the absolute minimum
set of common utilities I need for other libraries without having to duplicate
the code in all of them.</p>

<p>Everything in this library is in <code>namespace Prion</code>, and can be used either by
explicit namespace qualification or via <code>using namespace Prion</code>. In practise,
you should never use the <code>prion/core</code> module or its namespace explicitly; it
will be included automatically in any other library that needs it.</p>

<p>Since Prion is header-only, it is not necessary to build Prion before using it
with any other library. The makefile included here exists mainly to be
referenced by inclusion in other projects&#8217; makefiles; it can also be used to
run Prion&#8217;s own unit tests.</p>
